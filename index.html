        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div id="about-text">
                <p>I recently graduated from Cornell with a Bachelor’s degree in <span class="italics">Information Science</span> (Behavioral Science, Data Science, and UX). I am currently pursing a Master’s degree in <span class="italics">Human-Computer Interaction</span> at UMD.</p>
                <p>As an aspiring <span class="italics">UX designer</span> with a solid foundation in <span class="italics">front-end development</span> and <span class="italics">data visualization</span>, I am fascinated by both the design and technical aspects behind the user experience. By bridging the gap between the two, I design flexible, <span class="blue-highlight">user-centered</span> solutions while keeping <span class="blue-highlight">technical constraints</span> in mind and work with developers to ensure a smooth implementation process.</p>
                <p>I aim to enhance <span class="blue-highlight">digital accessibility</span> through my work to share modern technological tools with as many people as possible, helping them solve <span class="blue-highlight">real world problems.</span></p>
                <p>In my free time, you will find me reading, watching Korean dramas, or feeding my sourdough starter.</p>
