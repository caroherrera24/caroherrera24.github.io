            <h1>PhD Visit Day</h1>
            <h2 class="light">Overview</h2>
            <p>This was a 3 month-long project for INFO 4340 (App Design and Prototyping). As part of a five-member team, I conducted  interviews with PhD students and analyzed the data to identity three main user goals on PhD Visit Day. We addressed these findings by designing and developing a high-fidelity app prototype with Vue.js and Bootstrap. The app aims to be a tool for prospective students on PhD Visit Day by helping them manage their schedule and explore their research areas.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Our client, the Information Science department at Cornell, asked us to create an app for prospective PhD students who are attending the College of Computing and Information Science (CIS)’s PhD Visit Day. Visit Day is an opportunity for prospective students to visit the Ithaca campus, interact with faculty, and meet their potential peers. It also helps inform their decision in regard to accepting the admissions offer at Cornell or not.</p>
            <p>The app is an opportunity to <span class="blue-highlight">the prospective students’ experience</span> during a hectic schedule and ensure a successful Visit Day.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>Our targeted users were prospective CIS PhD students attending Visit Day. We wanted to understand users' overall attitudes towards the PhD Visit Day and what they consider to be a positive experience. To do this, I conducted a total of <span class="italics">6 semi-structured interviews</span> with current Information Science PhD students who previously attended the event.</p>
            <img class="width-100" src="../public/images/phd-visit-day/affinity-diagram.png" alt="A diagram demonstrating the data analysis. Please refer to the subsequent text for details.">
            <p class="image-caption">By creating an affinity diagram, we learned that prospective students had a desire to: (a) understand research areas covered at Cornell, (b) understand the program by talking to people, (c) make connections with peers, (d) have a productive day, (e) know what campus is like, and (f) know what to prepare before leaving for the visit days.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When selecting doctoral programs, they want to ensure it is a good fit for their research interests.</li>
                <li>PhD students were unfamiliar with the Ithaca region before being admitted.</li>
                <li>Prospective students expressed an interest in meeting other prospective students in a casual setting.</li>
                <li>The itinerary was overwhelming for many prospective students and logistically challenging for some.</li>
                <li>Students prefer using a mobile application to check the itinerary.</li>
            </ol>
            <p id="key-finding" class="white-box">We learned that there is a need for a mobile application that includes itinerary management, focusing on research, and facilitates social bonding between potential peers.</p>

            <h3>User Goals</h3>
            <p>From our data analysis, we identified three main user goals to address in our app and improve user experience on Visit Day:</p>
            <ul id="user-goals" class="white-box-list row">
                <li class="white-box row">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i>
                    <p>Prioritize attending events with labs and professors that align with their research interests</p>
                </li>
                <li class="white-box row">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-users"></i>
                    <p>Make connections with other students more conveniently</p>
                </li>
                <li class="white-box row">
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-map"></i>
                    <p>Move efficiently between activities</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Persona</h3>
            <p>To summarize our understanding of the target users, we created a persona called Jack Dorsey.</p>
            <div id="persona" class="white-box">
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="../public/images/phd-visit-day/jack.png" width="192" height="191" alt="Jack Dorsey">
                    <div id="persona-details">
                        <p class="bold">Jack Dorsey</p>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Biography</h4>
                <p>Jack is an accepted CIS Ph.D. student who received offers from both University of California, Berkeley and Cornell University. He is facing a tough decision on which program to choose. Since he has never visited Cornell before, he sees the visit day as a chance to gain a deeper understanding of the program and the location, which will help him make his final decision. He wants to tour different labs to see which best fits his research interests. He also wants to connect with other prospective and current PhD students at Cornell with the latter helping him learn more about the student experience. Because Jack has never been to Cornell’s Ithaca campus before, he is relying heavily on the itinerary and information provided by the department to navigate his way around during his visit.</p>

            <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
            <p>We discussed potential features that could address the user’s goals. We came up with a list of requirements that are essential for solving the major user goals we identified.

                        <p>Each team member created a sketch of their design for the app.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>We performed a “gallery walk” with each team member’s design and placed a sticky note on aspects of the design that appealed to them. This helped us identify features that we gravitated towards and commonalities between members’ designs.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Each member presented their designs and the listening team members provided feedback on the designs. Some talking points were debating the use of profile pictures to fight bias, feasibility of implementing third party apps, whether or not users really needed a link to the reimbursement form, user flows, and filter implementation/usefulness for research areas.</li>
                    <li>
                        We selected features of each team member’s design that we wanted to include in our final design.

            <h2>App Prototype</h2>
            <p>Based on the design, I led the development of a high-fidelity web app prototype using <span class="italics">Vue.js, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS</span> with my team. The app was originally designed for mobile devices because we expect users to rely on their phones on Visit Day according to our user research, but it also responsive.</p>
            <p>Due to time constraints, we ultimately decided to consolidate the design of the faculty and students' profile because they shared similar components, such as the contact information and research areas badges.</p>
            <p>The prototype demonstrates the features that Jack can use when he goes to visit Cornell. In our prototype, we assume that Jack has already completed the onboarding form and set up his profile, allowing us to focus on the app’s functionality and users’ interactions with the app’s main features.</p>
