            <h1>Improving the UMD Athletics Stadium Volunteer Experience</h1>
            <h2 class="light">Overview</h2>
            <p>As part of my coursework for INST 710 (User Experience Research Methods), I collaborated with 3 other UX researchers to understand how volunteers at UMD stadium games influence the fan experience. To do this, we conducted 5 interviews along with a survey. After our data analysis, we identified volunteers’ and consumers’ pain points.  We created the design concept of an online ordering system that allows customers to order food and alcohol online for themselves and family/friends while following stadium policies and guidelines as a solution.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The University of Maryland’s Department of Intercollegiate Athletics is interested in improving fan engagement and attendance at their stadium games. Fan attendance is relatively low, and fans often begin to leave after halftime. We were tasked with digging deeper into the reason behind this and discovering how we can improve the fan experience.</p>
            <p>Our group specifically focused on stadium volunteers as a stakeholder in this issue. Stadium volunteers work in the concession stands at basketball and football games as part of a fundraising event for a non-profit organization. In return, the non-profit receives a percentage of that day’s sales. We wanted to cover the aspects of the fan-volunteer interactions to come to a solution.</p>

            <h2>Research Question</h2>
            <p id="research-question" class="white-box">How do stadium volunteers influence the experience of fans at University of Maryland sports games?</p>
            <p>Our project aims to understand not only how the process of volunteering affects the experience of volunteers but, more importantly, how the experience of fans of University of Maryland sports games are affected by stadium volunteers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>Our user research methodologies included:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bold">Contextual interviews:</span> We interviewed and observed stadium volunteers working at the concessions stands</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Surveys:</span> We gathered insights about stadium volunteers’ thoughts and feelings about their volunteering experience</li>
            </ol>


            <h3>Method 1: Contextual Interviews</h3>
            <p>We conducted a total of 5 interviews. Our participants were all current stadium volunteers and undergraduate students that were volunteering on the behalf of 2 different UMD-affiliated clubs.</p>
            <p>4 contextual interviews took place during a men’s basketball game at the Xfinity Center. 2 of the participants were volunteering at a food concession stand and the other 2 were at a beer concession stand. These contextual interviews allowed us to observe the stadium volunteers’ environment, tasks, and interactions with customers.</p>

            <div class="image-gallery row">
                <img id="food-concessions" src="../public/images/umd-stadium-volunteers/food-concessions.jpg" alt="Four stadium volunteers stand behind the counter of concessions stand. Two of them attend to customers" />
                <img id="map" src="../public/images/umd-stadium-volunteers/kitchen-layout.jpg" alt="Sketch of a the kitchen layout. At the back of the kitchen, there is an oven, table, and sink. In the front, there is a fridge, a fries station, and another table. Another fridge takes up the right wall." />
                <img id="beer-stand" src="../public/images/umd-stadium-volunteers/beer-stand-front.jpg" alt="Two stadium volunteers stand behind the beer stand.">
                <img id="taller-image" src="../public/images/umd-stadium-volunteers/beer-stand-back.jpg" alt="Behind the counter, there are three beer taps, two stacks of plastic cups, and a payment terminal.">
            </div>

            <p>The fifth interview was conducted off-site with a volunteer who worked in the kitchen of the food concession stand. This filled in a gap in our knowledge about the food preparation process because we were not granted access behind the counter by the concessions manager due to their regulations. With the participant, we sketched a model of the kitchen’s layout, demonstrating how volunteers navigate the space.</p>

            <h3>Method 2: Surveys</h3>
            <p>We ran a survey to discover information about the volunteers’ experience, notably before they arrive at the stadium and after the game ended. We also wanted to gain insights about the volunteers’ motivations and feelings regarding their experience.</p>
            <p>We recruited participants with known volunteering experience through email and social media, receiving 16 responses. All respondents were affiliated with UMD and volunteered for a student organization at UMD. 81.25% (13/16) of respondents were undergraduate students, 12.5% (2/16) were graduate students, and 6.25% (1/16) was an exchange student.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <div class="row graphs">
                    <img src="../public/images/umd-stadium-volunteers/volunter-experience-chart.png" alt="A bar chart titled 'How as your experience volunteering?' 1 and 2 recieved no respones. 3 recieved three responses, 4 recieved 8 responses, and 5 recieved five responses." />

            </div>
            <p>The stadium volunteers viewed their experiences as generally positively. However, after closely analyzing our data through <a class="link" href="https://www.figma.com/board/I1zxQmlxQ8BltH8shY6P9l/Affinity-Diagram?node-id=2022-3662&t=G6o5j6YdP32sFS8M-1">affinity diagramming</a>, we identified some shortcomings with the volunteering process that hinder the customer experience as well as pleasure points that serve user delight.</p>

                        <h4>Frustrations</h4>
                        <p>Julia was frustrated with the lack of preparation before volunteering because customers expect to be skilled in her role. A pain point for Julia is that customers can be very rude to her. Volunteering is very time-consuming and mentally draining. </p>

                        <p>Julia is required to volunteer as a member of her dance team. Julia’s main goal is support her dance club by helping raise money for the club’s transportation and other necessities. She also wants to spend time with her friends and teammates.</p>
                        <h4>Needs and Expectations</h4>
                        <p>Julia expects customers to be patients and understanding with her because she is a student. She needs to be mentally prepare beforehand because she is anticipating a long shift with minimal breaks at the stadium.</p>

            <h3>Physical Model</h3>
            <p>Based on the data we collected, we identified three main groups that volunteers interact with while working at the concession stand: team members, UMD concessions employees, and customers. We created a physical model to show the different types of relationships that concession stand volunteers have and how that can impact the fan experience.</p>

            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>We combined features from our visioning session to come to a single conceptual product. Our idea is an app that has your ticket, ID,  and can track orders and the amount of alcohol you can have. There is verification for ID on the app to ensure younger people aren’t trying to put in fake IDs. The app has a unique QR code for each user that users need to show to the volunteers. The volunteers can scan the QR code and it will show them the person’s ID and alcohol limit. Fans can order food to specific concession stands, and the concession stands will receive the orders. They are able to pay on the app (although they can pay in person if they wish). Then the app will tell them when the food is ready. Fans can add friends and family to a group so they can order and pickup for others too.</p>
